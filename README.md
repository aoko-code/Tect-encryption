# Text-encryption

There are many ways of encryption, in this stage of my learning , am goung to use Caesar cipher and AES. 
## Caesar cipher 
it is reported to be first used by Julius Caesar to communicate secretely. It is one of the first encription techniques.
A letter in plaintext is shifted a certain number down the alphabet. We can only assume that they used the same english alphabets, it applys regardless of the alphabets used. The ammount of times you shift is the key.
It is easy to break hence not used for serious encryption.

In this project you will be required to enter word you want to cipher and the mode (encrypt or decrypt) and the technology you want, for now I will just use Caesar and AES. Now lets talk about AES:

## AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)
This is a symmetric encryption algorithm developed by Joan Daemen(Thought it was a woman , had to look it up LOL) and Vincent Rijmen(and its also a coincidence that their second names end with "men" they are not brothers as I thought)
It supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. Considered to be vesy secure when used correctly.
Used in protocols like TLS, SSH, AND WPA2(Wi-Fi encryption) 
### How to run the AES web application
